# Canvas APIs for PowerShell
### About
This project contains a few separate approaches to the Canvas APIs (standard, and data) for PowerShell. Use at your own risk, or contribute to the project and make it better!

##### Canvas API Generator
This script aims to automate the creation of the bulk parts of the general Canvas API Client for PowerShell, by scraping the documentation pages and converting the HTML data in to formatted methods. It is not yet working, and has some issues that need to be addressed with multivalued or repeating properties.

##### Canvas API Main
This script contains the primary authentication bits for the main Canvas API, as well as a number of manually thrown-together functions with no documentation.

##### Canvas Data API
This script contains wrappers for the Canvas Data API and some companion functions that can be used to ease the burden of working with the Canvas Data APIs.



Good luck, and enjoy!
